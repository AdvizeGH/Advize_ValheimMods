#pragma warning disable CS8632
	/// <summary>
	/// Class that specifies how a setting should be displayed inside the ConfigurationManager settings window.
	/// 
	/// Usage:
	/// This class template has to be copied inside the plugin's project and referenced by its code directly.
	/// make a new instance, assign any fields that you want to override, and pass it as a tag for your setting.
	/// 
	/// If a field is null (default), it will be ignored and won't change how the setting is displayed.
	/// If a field is non-null (you assigned a value to it), it will override default behavior.
	/// </summary>
	/// 
	/// <example> 
	/// Here's an example of overriding order of settings and marking one of the settings as advanced:
	/// <code>
	/// // Override IsAdvanced and Order
	/// Config.AddSetting("X", "1", 1, new ConfigDescription("", null, new ConfigurationManagerAttributes { IsAdvanced = true, Order = 3 }));
	/// // Override only Order, IsAdvanced stays as the default value assigned by ConfigManager
	/// Config.AddSetting("X", "2", 2, new ConfigDescription("", null, new ConfigurationManagerAttributes { Order = 1 }));
	/// Config.AddSetting("X", "3", 3, new ConfigDescription("", null, new ConfigurationManagerAttributes { Order = 2 }));
	/// </code>
	/// </example>
	/// 
	/// <remarks> 
	/// You can read more and see examples in the readme at https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager
	/// You can optionally remove fields that you won't use from this class, it's the same as leaving them null.
	/// </remarks>
